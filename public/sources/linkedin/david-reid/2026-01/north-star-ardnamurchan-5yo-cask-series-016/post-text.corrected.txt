Saturday night's special was a delicious bottling from North Star Spirits - a lovely 5 year old distilled at the Ardnamurchan Distillery in August 2015 and bottled in July 2021. At 52.5% it packs a wee punch, but pairs well with fruit cake and spicy salami. The nose is bananas and raisins, with orange peel, tropical fruit and cinnamon on the palate. I'm a massive fan of Iain Croucherr's work and this beauty did not disappoint.

#MyWeekendDram Saturday night's special was a
delicious bottling from North Star Spirits and their
016 Cask Series - a lovely 5 year old distilled at the
Ardnamurchan Distillery in August 2015 and bottled
in July 2021. At 52.5% it packs a wee punch, but pairs
well with fruit cake and spicy salami. The nose is
bananas and raisins, with orange peel, tropical fruit
and cinnamon on the palate. I'm a massive fan oflain
Croucherr's work and this beauty did not disappoint.

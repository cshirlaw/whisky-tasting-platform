David Reid - MyWeekendDram - Slightly spoilt for choice this weekend having been at Whisky Live Paris and probably tried around 50 whiskies from around the world. I'm going to go with this SIGNATORY VINTAGE SCOTCH WHISKY COMPANY LIMITED 30 year old The Glenrothes which was matured in a first fill Oloroso butt. Intense sherry richness with walnut, prune, and treacle, roasted hazelnuts, pipe smoke and spiced fruitcake. This is a sensational dram - elegant and warming, with an earthy aftertaste.

#MyWeekendDram - Slightly spolit for choice this
weekend having been at Whisky Live Paris with
RBrand Design and probably tried around 50 whiskies
from around trhe world. I'm going to go with this
SIGNATORY VINTAGE SCOTCH WHISKY COMPANY
LIMITED 30 year old The Glenrothes which was
matured in a first fill Oloroso butt. Intense sherry
richness with walnut, prune, and treacle, roasted
hazelnuts, pipe smoke and spiced fruitcake. This is a
sensational dram - elegant and warming, with an
earthy aftertaste.

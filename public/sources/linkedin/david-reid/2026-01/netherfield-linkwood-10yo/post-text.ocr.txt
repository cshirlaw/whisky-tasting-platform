#MyWeekendDram Through RBrand Design | met
Radmila Istomina and her husband Roman, owners of
Netherfield.
It's a fantastic little company based in Strathaven,
South Lanarkshire. Netherfield are building their own
distillery, but while they wait they slowly release small
batches of exceptional whiskies that they've come
across during their travels.
On Friday night | treated myself to their 10 year old
Speyside Linkwood. A beautifully smooth dram, with
notes of lemony zest and soor plooms. Whilst the
prawn curry was cooking, | may have helped myself
to another.

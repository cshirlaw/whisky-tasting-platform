Whisky Tasting Note

Whisky name:
Grant’s Triple Wood Smoky

Category:
Blended Scotch Whisky

ABV:
40%

Nose
Light smoke on entry, quickly giving way to muted malt and a slightly flat sweetness. Aromas feel simple and somewhat disjointed.

Palate
Thin and straightforward. Mild smoke, a touch of caramel, but little depth or development. The flavours pass quickly without leaving a clear impression.

Finish
Short and dry. Smoke lingers briefly, then fades without character.

Overall impression
Unremarkable and forgettable. Nothing overtly wrong, but nothing that invites a second look.

Would you buy it again?
No.

Whisky Tasting Note

Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky

50%

Nose
Clean and bright. Fresh barley, citrus peel, green apple and a gentle maritime note. No smoke, but plenty of freshness.

Palate
Lively and textured. Sweet malt, lemon zest, a touch of salinity and light oak spice. Feels honest and well balanced.

Finish
Medium length. Drying barley, soft pepper and a faint coastal note.

Overall impression
A clear, confident expression of unpeated Islay whisky. Characterful without being showy.

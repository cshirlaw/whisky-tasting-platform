DATA USAGE
Whisky Tasting Platform


Purpose

This document explains how data is used, analysed, and monetised.
It exists to protect trust, independence, and clarity.


1. What data we collect

We collect three types of data:

- expert tasting material
- professional contextual input
- consumer tasting contributions

We also collect limited technical metadata needed to organise and analyse this material.

We do not collect personal data beyond what is required to manage contributions.


2. What we do with tasting data

Tasting data is used to:

- compare whiskies
- identify patterns in preference
- understand how whiskies are perceived across markets
- support education and informed choice

Expert judgement remains distinct.
Consumer input adds perspective but does not replace expertise.


3. Aggregation and anonymity

Consumer data is always analysed in grouped, anonymous form.

We do not sell, trade, or expose individual consumer opinions.
We do not profile individuals.
We do not allow third parties to access raw consumer-level data.


4. Commercial use of insights

We may generate commercial insight products based on aggregated analysis.

Examples include:
- market perception summaries
- comparative category reports
- regional preference analysis
- packaging and presentation feedback
- education and training material

These insights describe patterns.
They do not promote individual products.


5. What we do not sell

We do not sell:
- favourable opinions
- rankings for payment
- endorsements
- hidden promotion
- access to expert judgement
- personal or identifiable data


6. Independence

Commercial relationships do not influence conclusions.

Payment does not change:
- how data is analysed
- how findings are reported
- how experts or consumers are represented

If independence cannot be maintained, the work is not undertaken.


7. Data access and control

Source material is retained for audit and reference.
Structured data is versioned and controlled.

Contributors may request removal of their contributions.
Aggregated analysis remains intact.


8. Change and review

This policy may evolve as the platform grows.
Any change will preserve the principles of:
- trust
- independence
- clarity

These principles are not negotiable.


Closing statement

This platform exists to understand whisky properly.
If data cannot be used honestly, it will not be used.

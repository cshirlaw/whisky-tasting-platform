It's a fantastic little company based in Strathaven, South Lanarkshire. Netherfield are building their own distillery, but while they wait they slowly release small batches of exceptional whiskies that they've come across during their travels. On Friday night I treated myself to their 10 year old Speyside Linkwood. A beautifully smooth dram, with notes of lemony zest and soor plooms. Whilst the prawn curry was cooking, I may have helped myself to another.",

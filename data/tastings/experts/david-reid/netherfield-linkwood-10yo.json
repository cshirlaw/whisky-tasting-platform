Netherfield are building their own distillery, but while they wait they slowly release small batches of exceptional whiskies that they have come across during their travels.\n\nOn Friday night I treated myself to their 10 year old Speyside Linkwood. A beautifully smooth dram, with notes of lemony zest and sour plooms. Whilst the prawn curry was cooking, I may have helped myself to another.",

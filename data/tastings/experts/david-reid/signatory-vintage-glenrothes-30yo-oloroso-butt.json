I'm going to go with this Signatory Vintage 30 year old The Glenrothes, which was matured in a first fill Oloroso butt. Intense sherry richness with walnut, prune, and treacle, roasted hazelnuts, pipe smoke and spiced fruitcake. This is a sensational dram - elegant and warming, with an earthy aftertaste.",

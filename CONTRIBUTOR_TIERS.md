CONTRIBUTOR TIERS
Whisky Tasting Platform


Purpose

This document defines who can contribute tasting material and how that material is treated.
It protects judgement, keeps trust, and avoids confusion between expertise and popularity.


1. Expert contributors

Experts are recognised whisky professionals.

Typical examples:
- whisky writers and journalists
- blenders, distillers, and production specialists
- independent bottlers with technical experience
- accredited whisky judges or long-standing commentators

Expert contributions:
- set the reference standard
- use structured tasting language
- may include technical detail
- are not overridden by popularity or voting

Experts may contribute:
- tasting notes
- comparisons
- contextual commentary
- educational material

Experts are identified by name.


2. Professional contributors

Professionals work in the whisky trade but are not presenting themselves as independent experts.

Typical examples:
- brand ambassadors
- sales and marketing professionals
- retailers and distributors
- hospitality professionals

Professional contributions:
- are welcome and valued
- provide market and contextual insight
- do not replace expert judgement

Professional contributions are:
- clearly identified as professional
- never blended into expert opinion


3. Consumer contributors

Consumers are enthusiasts and drinkers with an interest in whisky.

Consumer contributions:
- reflect personal taste
- show how whisky is experienced in real settings
- help identify patterns across regions and cultures

Consumer contributions:
- do not claim authority
- do not replace expert judgement
- are used in grouped, anonymous form for analysis

Individual consumer opinions are respected.
Commercial use is always aggregated and anonymous.


4. Separation of roles

Expert, professional, and consumer contributions are never merged.

Each tier:
- has a clear label
- has a clear purpose
- is analysed separately

This separation protects trust and clarity.


5. Independence

No contributor tier can be bought.
Payment, access, or partnership does not change how contributions are treated.


6. Accreditation (future)

Formal accreditation may be introduced later.
Any accreditation will be:
- transparent
- limited
- grounded in demonstrated knowledge

Accreditation will never be automatic or commercial.


Closing note

Clarity matters more than volume.
Judgement matters more than noise.

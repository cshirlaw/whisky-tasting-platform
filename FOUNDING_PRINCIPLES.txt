FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
Whisky Tasting Platform


1. Honesty comes first
We exist to understand whisky as people experience it.
We do not shape opinion for commercial gain.


2. Scotch whisky is Scottish
Knowledge, judgement, and authority begin in Scotland.
Others may take part, but Scotland leads.


3. Experts lead; consumers contribute
Experienced whisky experts set standards and language.
Consumers contribute their views and comparisons.


4. Order matters
Opinion without order is hard to use.
Clear structure helps people understand and compare.


5. Understanding before recommendation
We try to explain why whiskies differ, and why people respond to them differently.
We compare whiskies to help people make their own choices.
We do not tell people what to buy.


6. We cannot be bought
Money does not affect what we say.
Working with others does not change our conclusions.


7. Data is handled properly
Personal contributions stay personal.
Only grouped, anonymous information is used for commercial work.


8. Growth cannot be forced
Trust, accuracy, and consistency come first.
We grow only as far and as fast as the idea allows.


WHAT WE WILL NEVER DO

We will never:

- Take money to promote a whisky
- Hide promotion inside commentary
- Change conclusions for payment or benefit
- Confuse popularity with expertise
- Sell personal data
- Weaken Scottish authority to grow faster
- Seek attention at the expense of trust
- Reduce whisky to a novelty


CLOSING STATEMENT

This platform is meant to last.
It is built on honesty, care, and clear thinking.

We seek to do things properly.
